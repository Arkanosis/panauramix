**panauramix** (PulseAudio NAtive, User-friendly, Realtime Audio MIXer) is a visual patch editor and mixer for [PulseAudio](http://pulseaudio.org/).

## Current Status

panauramix is still under active design and not yet ready for mainstream usage.

## Design goals

panauramix aims at the following objectives:
* provide an easy, visual way to configure “patches”, that is, to plug audio inputs to audio outputs through PulseAudio;
* be driveable through physical controlers (such as the [Korg nanoKONTROL Studio](http://www.korg.com/products/computergear/nanokontrol_studio/) or the [Icon Platform M](http://iconproaudio.com/product/platform-m/));
* store its configuration in an easy to read, easy to edit format that can be versionned using tools like git.
